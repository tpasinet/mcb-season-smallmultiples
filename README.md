# A Season in Small Multiples

A Season in Small Multiples is a project that displays a NCAA Men's Basketball team's season as a series of small graphs arrayed in a matrix, a small multiple. The project harvest play-by-play data for a team's entire schedule from ESPN web pages and constructs a display of cumulative score over the course of each game and a display of the score margin over the course of each game. Currently, the display format is static PDF. The goal is to progress to an interactive R Shinny application.
